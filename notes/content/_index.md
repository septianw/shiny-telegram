Some of my experiment are so simple, they don't even need a documentation, as the code will explain itself. But as the load are heavy, even the simplest thing need some explanation, that's when this documentation will really help.

I will try to put everything here as i can, but sometime i have time i need to skip to do something more important in my life.
