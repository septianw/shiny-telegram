Hello World,

This is the beginning to start my journaling habbit again, since in the past time i am out of resource to continue my habbit. If i say resource it mean any kind of resource including space and time. But recently, i managed to encourage myself to collecting all of resource i have, to continue my journaling habbit.

Since i can't do something big on daily basis, i'll write my experiment, and documenting about it. The experiments will conduct in a random manner, i'll write anything that come in my mind, when i feel the time is enough to write it. When i can't continue it until the end, i'll write it as a draft or documenting it in source code itself.

This whole note are my effort to remember it again when i need it, when it's helpful to anyone, please leave some credit. Thank you.
